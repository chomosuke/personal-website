# C++

## 2014
- My dad handed me a book about programming in C++ using Visual Studio which I read during my free time.
- I then created a [terminal based clone](../works/2048.md) of 2048.

## 2021
- As a member of [the general committee for the University of Melbourne Programming Club](../experiences/umcpc-general-committee.md.md), I hosted two C++ workshop aimed at teaching beginner C++. I had to thoroughly learn and understand C++ to ensure that I don't have any incorrect information in the workshop.
