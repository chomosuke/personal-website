# C

## 2013
- My dad handed me a book about the C programming language which I read in my free time. He also taught me to write some simple programs in C such as listing out all the prime numbers.

## 2019-2021
- I learned C again in the university subject Foundations of Algorithms. A few subjects also require us to complete assignments in C ([example](../works/process-scheduler.md)).
