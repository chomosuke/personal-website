# General committee of The University of Melbourne Competitive Programming Club
2020-2021

- After being a member of the University of Melbourne Competitive Programming Club for several semesters, I ran and was elected as a member of the general committee.
- As a part of my duty as a committee member, I hosted two 2 hours long C++ workshop aimed at beginners.
- I had to thoroughly study and understand C++ to make sure there isn't any incorrect information in my workshop.
- Overall my workshops was received positively among our club members.
