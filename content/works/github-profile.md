# GitHub Profile
2023

[Source Code](https://github.com/chomosuke/chomosuke/blob/master/update.py)

## Summary
A python script that updates my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/chomosuke) daily.

## Description
- GitHub allow its users to display a markdown file in their profile.
- I wanted to list all my open source contributions in my profile. However, I have made more than 20 contributions over the years and I do not want to collect and update them manually.
- I decided to write a [Python](../skills/python.md) script that would run daily to update my GitHub profile for me.
- Utilizing GitHub's API, I wrote the script and configured it to run daily with [GitHub Actions](../skills/github-action.md).
- As a result, I can put a section on my resume that simply link to the up-to-date GitHub profile [open source contributions section](https://github.com/chomosuke/chomosuke#pull-requests).
