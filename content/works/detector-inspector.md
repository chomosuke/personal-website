# Associated Developer at Detector Inspector

## Summary
My first and only job where I worked with PHP, JavaScript, AWS and MySQL.

## Description
- My main job consisted of maintaining our legacy [PHP](../skills/php.md) internal website written with [CakePHP](../skills/cakephp.md) that the company used to manage their bookings, technicians and finances etc.
- I also worked with vanilla [JavaScript](../skills/javascript.md), [AWS](../skills/aws.md) and [MySQL](../skills/mysql.md).
- During my time there, I worked on various efforts to improve our legacy system. Some notable examples are:
	- I created a sharable ESLint config for all our JavaScript projects.
	- I worked with our data architect on a Data Catalog that would allow the team to document our monolithic SQL database with more than 500 undocumented tables.
	- I hosted sessions with another coworker to pitch the usage of [TypeScript](../skills/typescript.md) instead of JavaScript for new projects.
