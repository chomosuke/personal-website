## Summary
The website you are looking at right now.

## Description
- To showcase all of my skills and back them up with real experiences, I've decided to create this website before I started to apply for internships in 2023.
- I worked with one of my designer friend to brainstorm and produce a creative design for this website.
- I used [Flutter](../skills/flutter.md) with [Dart](../skills/dart.md) to create this website because it is the best framework for complex animation which our design contains.
- It is hosted on [AWS](../skills/aws.md) as a [Docker](../skills/dart.md) container.
