# Summary
A university group project which we had to develop a CRM based on a "client"'s requests.

# Description
- In the university subject COMP30022 IT Project, we were required to form into teams of 5 and develop a CRM base on a "client"'s requirement.
- The client was a Master of Computer science student who asked us to develop a simple CURD application that would store business cards with some key value fields.
- We used [MongoDB](../skills/mongodb.md) as our database, [TypeScript](../skills/typescript.md), [Node.js](../skills/node-js.md) and [Express.js] for our backend, and [TypeScript](../skills/typescript.md) and [React.js](../skills/react-js.md) for our frontend.
- We were proactive and well organized. Even going above and beyond to set up continuous intergration with [GitHub Actions](../skills/github-action.md). We ended up almost finishing the app **two weeks** ahead of the due date.
- In the end all of our team members achieve high marks for the subject.
