2022

## Summary
My personal NeoVim config that allows me to use NeoVim as my daily driver.

## Description
- I started using NeoVim after watching [William Lin](https://www.youtube.com/@tmwilliamlin168) winning a [Google Kickstart Round](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oY0PBQt36YM) while using Vim.
- I wrote my configuration from scratch in [Lua](../skills/lua.md) over a few months.
- The configuration includes ability to install and configure language servers and debugger adaptors, as well as various other utilities.
- This allows me to daily drive NeoVim and significantly improving my code editing speed.
