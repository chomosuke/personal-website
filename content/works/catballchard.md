## Summary
A web app made with rust and flutter to store random photos with fun descriptions.

## Description
- After finished my last exams for my bachelor degree, I had some free time on my hand.
- As an exercise to learn [Flutter](../skills/flutter.md) and [Rust](../skills/rust.md), I decided to create a web app that allows anyone to upload photos with some descriptions.
- To build this web app, I used [rocket.rs](../skills/rocket-rs.md) as the backend framework and [MongoDB](../skills/mongodb.md) as the database.
- The web app was initially hosted on Heroku using [Docker](../skills/docker.md). Though as Heroku [discontinued their free hosting offer](https://blog.heroku.com/next-chapter), I moved catballchard to [AWS ECS](./chomosuke-com.md).
- It is now hosted at [https://catballchard.chomosuke.com/](https://catballchard.chomosuke.com/).
