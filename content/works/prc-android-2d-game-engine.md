## Summary
A 2D mini game engine for Android based on OpenGL ES.

## Description
- I created this mini game engine for my game [Project Rocket](./project-rocket.md) before I knew game engines existed.
- While I can not say this game engine have any advantage over any real game engines, it does provide most of the functionality needed to create an Android 2D game. The functionality it provides includes:
	- Drawing texture.
	- Drawing basic geometric shapes such as triangle, ellipse, polygon etc.
	- Performant collision detections.
	- Multithreading utilities.
