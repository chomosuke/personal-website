# 2048
2014

## Summary
A terminal based 2048 clone.

## Description
After reading a book about [C++](../skills/cpp.md), I decided to write a little game to practice my newly learned skill. I choose to make a clone of the then popular game 2048. As one of my first creation, the code is nothing to write home about. It had alphabetical variable name and consisted of one single 600 line function. It took me one month to iron out all the bugs and have the game working as expected.
