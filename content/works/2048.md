# 2048
2014

Source code: I have unfortunately left it in an old computer in New Zealand.

## Summary
A terminal based 2048 clone.

## Description
- After reading a book about [C++](../skills/cpp.md), I decided to write a little game to practice my newly learned skill.
- I choose to make a clone of the then popular game 2048.
- As one of my first creation, the code is nothing to write home about. It had alphabetical variable names and consisted of one single 600 lines function.
- It took me one month to iron out all the bugs and have the game working as expected.
