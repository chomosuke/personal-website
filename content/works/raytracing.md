# Ray Tracing shader in Unity

## Summary
I wrote a Ray Tracing shader in one day using HLSL in Unity.

## Description
- For the university subject COMP30019 Graphics and Interaction, we were required to write a Unity project generating a mountainous landscape using the diamond square algorithm.
- We were also required to generate some fairly trivial waters in that landscape.
- As a challenge to myself, I decided to go above and beyond to implement transparent water with reflection and refraction using non-recursive ray tracing.
- I believe this is achievable because of of the specific way diamond square algorithm work. For the landscape generated by the diamond square algorithm, when viewed from top to bottom it almost looks like a perfect grid. This means that, when doing collision detection for a single ray, I only have to check the triangles that the ray cross directly above or below, and as a result, lower the time complexity from O(n) to O(sqrt(n)), where n is the number of triangle in our landscape mesh.
- After some research and planning, I wrote and debugged the entire shader in **one single day**.
- In the end, I was able to achieve 80fps on my GTX 1050 ti with 32768 triangles in the landscape mesh.
