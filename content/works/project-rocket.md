## Summary
A simple time killer game about a rocket flying in space collecting stars and avoiding planet.

## Description
- After being put into accelerated classes and completing most of my final year of high school early, I decide to use my free time to create a mobile game.
- Before this I was a complete beginner, having only done [the 2048 clone](./2048.md).
- I completed most of the game's core functionality in [Java](../skills/java.md) in the first half of 2018 before porting it to [Kotlin](../skills/kotlin.md).
- I learned many of my programming fundamentals while making this game: the importance of good naming and coding style, the use of git as a version control system, and many principles and design patterns of object-oriented programming.
- Because I didn't know game engine existed at the time, I wrote the entire game on top of [OpenGL](../skills/opengl.md). I later factored out the graphics part of the game into a standalone mini game engine with the descriptive name: [PRC Android 2D game engine](./prc-android-2d-game-engine.md).
- While the game didn't make any money as I had hoped, it did gain more than [1000 downloads on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chomusukestudio.projectrocketc).
