# Process Scheduler Simulation in C
2021

## Summary
One of my university assignment.

## Description
- In a university assignment for the subject Computer Systems, we were required to simulate a processor scheduler for a multicore CPU using [C](../skills/c.md).
- To reduce the complexity of the program, I applied Object-Oriented Programming techniques by having structs and their "methods" organized into their own files.
- To aid in memory management, I implemented destructors for appropriate structs and documented their destruction responsibilities.
- As a result, I completed the assignment with relative ease and achieve a high mark of 97%.
